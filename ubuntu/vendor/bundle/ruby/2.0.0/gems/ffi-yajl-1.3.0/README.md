This was initially going to be a clean rewrite of an ffi ruby wrapper around yajl2, but as it progressed more and more code was
pulled in from brianmario's existing yajl-ruby gem, particularly all the c extension code, lots of specs and the benchmarks.  And the
process of writing this would have been much more difficult without being able to draw heavily from already solved problems in
yajl-ruby.
