## Installation

Berkshelf is now included as part of the [Chef-DK](http://getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk). This is fastest, easiest, and the recommended installation method for getting up and running with Berkshelf.

> note: You may need to uninstall the Berkshelf gem especially if you are using a Ruby version manager you may need to uninstall all Berkshelf gems from each Ruby installation.

### From Rubygems

If you are a developer or you prefer to install from Rubygems, we've got you covered.

Add Berkshelf to your repository's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'berkshelf'
```

Or run it as a standalone:

    $ gem install berkshelf

## Usage

## Supported Platforms

Berkshelf is tested on Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0, and 2.1.

Ruby 1.9 mode is required on all interpreters.

Ruby 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 are not officially supported. If you encounter problems, please upgrade to Ruby 2.0 or 1.9.3.
